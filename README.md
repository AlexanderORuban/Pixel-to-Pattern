## Environment Variables

# Change to create a .env in backend and .env.local in frontend

This project utilizes environment variables for configuration. You need to create a `db.env` file in the root directory based on the provided variable examples listed below.

   **Required Variables:**

   *   `DB_USER`: The username for the user created to run the database.
   *   `DB_PASSWORD`: Your password used to access the database.
   *   `DB_HOST`: The IP for the virtual machine running the database.
   *   `DB_DATABASE`: name of the database you need to access.
   *   `DB_PORT`: The port number the database is running on.

Edit `db.env` and replace placeholder values with your actual configuration.
Restart your development server if it's already running (e.g., npm start).
